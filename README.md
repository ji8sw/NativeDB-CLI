# NativeDB-CLI
A tool to view GTA 5 native functions in a command line interface.
Based on my **[NativeNameLengths](https://github.com/ji8sw/NativeNameLengths)** tool.
Harnesses & retrieves data from [Alloc8or's native data](https://github.com/alloc8or/gta5-nativedb-data)

## This is by no means a replacement to any other native database, this is a fun tool made due to boredom and a way to learn.
